  <h3>What problem does the paper solve and why is this interesting?</h3>
  Hedges et al. assemble an global evolutionary timetree of life (TTOL) from smaller timetrees in existing literature in order to study how the rate of speciation has changed over time and are able to conclude that speciation is driven by time dependent mutations called genetic imcompatabilities (GIs) and not by adaptation. Hedges et al. also determine that the rate of diversification in eukaryotes is growing or staying the same in the vast majority of clades. Hedges et al. identify a number of biases which could have caused other studies to concluding that the rate of diversification was decreasing including the use of stem age rather than crown age during the analysis of timetrees.
  <h3>How do they solve this problem?</h3>
  Hedges et al. fuse existing published timetrees into a global timetree. They focus their analysis on eukaryotes. The large TTOL allowed for an analysis of lineage across a wide range of eukaryotes. Hedges et al. find that diversification in eukaryotes closely matches a simulated pure birth-death (BD) model with a slight increase in the last 200 million years.
  <br><br>
  Of the 58 analyzed Linnean clades, only one – Angiosperms – hypo-expansion using the coalescent model, possibly explainably by its low level of sampling (which is known to bias towards hypo-expansion). None of the clades showed hypo-expansion using the gamma test.
  <br><br>
  There was a significant correlation found between clade age and clade size, which supports diversification by expansion, this was supported by analysis on mammals and birds.
  <br><br>
  The time-to-speciation (TTS) of vertibrae, arthropods, and plants were found to be similar: about 2 million years. Hedges et al. suggest that speciation occurs when a critical mass of GIs have occured and postzygotic reproductive isolation is established. Since relatively few populations remain isolated until the critical mass of GIs has occured, failed speciation may occur multiple times which may explain "barcode gaps." Branching events in an evolutionary tree mark the moment two populations became separated, not the moment of speciation. Branch lengths longer than the TTS include "lag time" which is time not part of a successful speciation event.
  <br><br>
  The consistency of TTS among sampled groups indicates that diversification occurs at a fixed rate, and that adaptation is largely decoupled from speciation (rather than being a driving force, as previously thought).
  <br><br>
  In support of this conclusion, mass extinctions do not lead to an increase in the rate of diversification even though large adaptive changes occur after these events.
  <h3>Future work and questions</h3>
  When more mature, timetrees should be analyzing with the fossil record to produce a more comprehensive tree.<br><br>
  Future work could include determining how speciation and adaptation are temporally related.
