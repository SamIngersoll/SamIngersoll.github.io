  <h3>What problem does the paper solve and why is this interesting?</h3>
    Johnson addresses the issue of the formation of calcium lactate crystals in cheddar cheese during storage. These crystals have been deemed undesirable reduce the percieved quality of the cheese. 
  <h3>How do they solve this problem?</h3>
  Johnson investigates the cause of crystal formation, considering storage temperature -which appears to be correlated with crystal formation- but concludes that instead it was the mobility of fluids (called free serum) that was responsible for the formation of crystals on the surface of the cheese. <br>
  Johnson perscribes several heuristics for combating crystal formation including: correct, sealed packaging, avoiding temperature cycling and moisture migration especially to the surface of the cheese. <br>
  The factor that inevitably dictates whether calcium lactate crystals will form is the calcium lactate level in the serum phase of the cheese.
  <h3>Future work and questions</h3>
  Although methods exist to lower the lactic acid levels in the cheese -such as curd rinsing and using milk with lower levels of lactic acid- little is known about the exact processes which control the nucleation and proliferation of the crystals. <br>
  Sharp cheddars are sharp because of their lactic acid levels, produced by the metabolism of lactose during the extended aging period.
