  <h2 id="Ch1">First Order Linear Differential Equations</h2>
  The solution to a differential equation is a function or class of functions.<br><br>
  <h3>Homogeneous Differential Equataions</h3> 
  Come in the form \( \dot{y} + p(t)y = 0 \)
  
  <h3>Inhomogeneous Differential Equations</h3> 
  Come in the form \( \dot{y} + p(t)y = q(t) \)

  <h3>Solving First Order ODEs</h3>
  There are many ways to solve first order linear differential equations. These are listed in order of how they should be attempted when approaching a problem.
  <h4>Separation of variables</h4>
  (For homogeneous ODEs)<br>
  Separation of variables is the first method that should be attempted when approaching a problem because it is the easiest and leads to a quick and clean solution. <br>
 <ol>
  <li>Move all \(y\) functions to one side and functions of \(t\) to the other side.</li>
  <li>Integrate both sides (they should both be functions of a single variable, \(y\) or \(t\)).</li>
  <li>(If given) Plug in initial condition to solve for integrating constant and find unique solution.</li>
 </ol>
  \[ \dot{y} + p(t)y = 0 \] 
  \[ \dot{y} = -p(t)y \]
  \[ \frac{\dot{y}}{y} = -p(t) \]
  \[ \int \frac{1}{y}dy = \int p(t) dt \]
  \[ ln(y) = P(t)+C \]
  \[ y = e^{P(t)+C} \]
  \[ y = e^{P(t)}e^C \]
  \[ y = Ce^{P(t)} \]

  <h4>Superposition</h4>
  (For inhomogeneous ODEs)<br>
  If the general solution to the homogeneous differential equation can be found as well as a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation, the two can be added together to get the general solution to the inhomogeneous differential equation.

  <h4>Variation of parameters</h4>
