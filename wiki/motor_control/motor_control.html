  <h1>Motor Control</h1>
  <b>Commutation</b> is the process of switching the phase or direction of current to produce motion in a motor.<br><br> 
  <b>Cogging</b> is torque due to the interactions between the permanent magnets (PM) and the stator in PM machines. It feels like the rotor is skipping or jumping as it rotates past each pole pair. Cogging can be characterized in one electric revolution and can be at least partially compensated for in the controller.

  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCEiOnuODac?t=32s">This video</a> describes the structure of a brushless permanent magnet motor and simple commutation using a hall effect sensor.
  <h3 id="basic-control">Basic Control (open loop)</h3>
  The most simple commutation strategy for a BLDC motor would be to provide a predefined waveform to the coils and have them pull the rotor up to speed. This open loop strategy is not a good way to run a BLDC motor because it power inefficient (especially at higher speeds) and does not drive the rotor smoothly. Both of these drawbacks result from the fact that the motor is commutated without consideration of rotor position, this can result in the magnetic field inadvertantly pushing the rotor in the incorrect direction if the commutation happens at the wrong time.

  The beginning of <a href="https://youtu.be/szgVUfyX8JM">this video</a> does a good job describing how normal sensorless commutation works. It also presents an alternative method which commutates based on the integral of the back EMF signal rather than the zero crossings.
